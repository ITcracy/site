# Automation

![Repetative Process](../../src/assets/automation_hero.svg)

- **There are some tasks which are as simple as,**

```
- File or folder operations like
  moving copying thousands of files
  or folders,
- Filling out online forms,
- Periodic downloading of files
  or copying text from a website,
- Sending periodic emails, etc.
```

- **Or can be as complex as,**
```
- Performing operations with
  Excel spreadsheets,
- Specific business process
  in an organization,
- Data consolidation from various
  sources and/or generation
  of some periodic reports,etc.
```

> All such tasks are `time-consuming` and they’re often so `trivial or specific` that there’s `no ready-made software` to perform them.

> **If you feel that you do repetative, time consuming and boring tasks, then you can ease your work-life with the following 3 steps.**

![Repetative Process](../../src/assets/automation_steps.svg)

### 1. Identify

**Identify the exact task or process that you think can be automated.**



You need to identify the process that is consuming most of your time or is repetative.

It can be a process that a single user does or it can be a process that is done at an organizational level.

### 2. Write IT
***No! Here we do not expect a technical document.***

> You just have to write the entire process that you want to automate.

>The write up should be something which will easily help in understanding the process.

>It should contain just enough details and all the requirements involved in the process.

>The requirements can be as simple as some **website urls, file names, period i.e. date & time, etc.**


**Note:** This is an optional step and we suggest writing your process as it helps in better understanding of your own process.
