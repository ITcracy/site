# Automation

> ***Automation*** can substantially help in reducing cost and increasing profitability.

> At ITcracy we help people reduce their efforts spent on repetitive manual work and focus more on the actual tasks that help grow the business.

### Why automate?

- **There are some tasks which are as simple as,**

```css
- File or folder operations like
  moving or copying thousands of files
  or folders,
- Filling out online forms,
- Periodic downloading of files
  or copying text from a website,
- Sending periodic emails, etc.
```

- **Or can be as complex as,**
```css
- Performing operations with
  Excel spreadsheets,
- Specific business process
  in an organization,
- Data consolidation from various
  sources and/or generation
  of some periodic reports, etc.
```

> All such tasks are `time-consuming`, and they’re often so `trivial or specific` that there’s `no ready-made software` to perform them.


***At `ITcracy` we provide cost effective solutions designed specific to the needs of user for all their requirements.***

## Want a Solution?
> **If you feel that you do repetitive, time-consuming and boring tasks, then you can ease your work-life with the following 3 steps.**

![Repetitive Process](../../src/assets/automation_steps.svg)

### 1. Identify

**Identify the exact task or process that you think can be automated.**

- You need to identify the process that is consuming most of your time or is repetitive.

- It can be a process that a single user does or it can be a process that is done at an organizational level.

### 2. Write IT

**No! Here we do not expect a technical document.**

- You just have to write the entire process that you want to automate.

- The write-up should be something which will easily help in understanding the process.

- It should contain just enough details and all the requirements involved in the process.

- The requirements can be as simple as some **website URLs, file names, period i.e. date & time, etc.**


**Note:** This is an optional step, and we suggest writing your process as it helps in better understanding of your own process.

### 3. Connect with us

**If your process cannot be automated, you won't be charged**

- Explain to us the process, along with supporting documents if any.

- We will check the feasibility and if it is possible to automate it, we will give you the approximate cost and time required to complete the task.

- We will provide alternate options if the task is not suitable for automation.

- Irrespective of whether you follow the first 2 steps you can always contact us.

- If you are `unsure` whether your process/s or task/s can be automated then `contact us`, and we will `help you identify` and if possible automate it.

**Please note that we don't charge if after analyzing your process we find that it cannot be automated. So feel free to connect with us.**
