# Application Development

> In ITcracy we help organizations create their presence online by building `Websites`, `Web Applications` and `Mobile Applications` for them.

## Want to get your business online!
It can be as simple as a static website or as complex as an e-commerce platform.

```python
[
  "Website to advertise your services",
  "A NGO hoping to get some donation by showing their deeds.",
  "A product company wanting to sell products online",
  "A business wanting to configure process through user interface",
  "And many more.."
]
```

## The Process

We follow below simple steps to build websites and applications,

- You contact us with a requirement of static, dynamic website or web application.
- We analyze the requirements and come up with a proposal of estimate time and cost involved.
- We send you some example themes from which you can choose.
- After you complete advance payment, we start development.
- We will keep you updated with the progress in stages with demo of the website.
- After the final demo and your final payment, the website will be live.


**Please note that you can contact us even if you are not sure whether a web application is suitable for your process or not.**
